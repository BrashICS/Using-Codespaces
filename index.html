    <h2>GitHub Codespaces</h2>
    <p>
      The codespaces environment is not free, the one you are working in right
      now is hosted and paid for by the "Team" you are in for class. There are
      certain limitations but it is improving all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Play around in here, try to run the node-script.js file, preview the
      index.html file, and maybe commit your changes.
