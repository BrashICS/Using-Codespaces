# Using Codespaces
The future of development is here. Codespaces allows you to code in a virtual machine as long as you have Internet connection.

The codespaces environment is not free, the one you are working in right now is hosted and paid for by the "Team" you are in for class. There are certain limitations but it is improving all the time.

Play around in here, try to run the node-script.js file, preview the index.html file, and maybe commit your changes.
